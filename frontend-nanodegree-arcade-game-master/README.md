##Arcade Game Frogger

In this Game you have to **move the Hero across the Street** into the Water to win.
On the Street Enemy Bugs will spawn and move from left to right in varying speed to block you. Once you collide with a Bug, you will be placed back at the starting position.
Enemy Bugs will only spawn on the Road and not in the green.

If you reach the water you will be placed back to the starting Position and a Rock will be placed at a random position in the Water to block one possible Path.
